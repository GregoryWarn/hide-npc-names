# Hide NPC Names

This module for Foundry VTT allows you to replace NPC names with an alternative of your choice. You can choose to hide names for friendly, neutral, hostile, and secret dispositions independently. You can toggle the name of a specific actor manually by clicking the reveal button next to their name.
